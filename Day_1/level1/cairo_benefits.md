# Benefits of using cairo for smart contract development

Cairo allows you to compute trustworthy values on untrusted machines, one major use case is starkNet, a solution to ethereum scaling

Insteaad of having all the participants in the network to verify transaction, only one node called the prover executes the program and generates proofs. this proofs are then verified by an ethereum smart contract requiring significantly less computational power hence reduced transaction costs
