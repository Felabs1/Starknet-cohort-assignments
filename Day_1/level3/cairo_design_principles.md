# Key Features and design principles of cairo

## Introduction

Cairo is a programming language designed for a virtual CPU of the same name
Generally created for the cryptographic aspects of this world

## Cairo benefits for Starknet development

it Allows for increased throughput and reduced transaction cost while maintaing ethereum security. this is achieved by the fact that only one node verifies transacctions by generating proofs that computations were done correctly

Since cairo works in a principle of veryfying in the smart contract, it becomes faster since veryfying is faster than computing.

## Design principles for smart contract development in Cairo

Cairo promotes modular code design allowing code reuse and enhancing maintainability of smart contracts

Cairo optimizes gas usage minimizing the cost of executing smart contracts on starknet

## Key Features of Cairo for Starknet Development

### Built in cryptography

The unique aspect of this processor is that it was not created for the physical constraints of our world but for cryptographic ones, making it capable of efficiently proving the execution of any program running on it. This means that you can perform time consuming operations on a machine you don't trust

### Standard Libraries
