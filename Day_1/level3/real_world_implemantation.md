# Real world use case where cairo has been implemented successfully for smart contract development

## StarkNet

Starknet is a Layer 2 built on top of Ethereum. Instead of having all the participants of the network to verify all user interactions, only one node, called the prover, executes the programs and generates proofs that the computations were done correctly. These proofs are then verified by an Ethereum smart contract, requiring significantly less computational power compared to executing the interactions themselves. This approach allows for increased throughput and reduced transaction costs while preserving Ethereum security.
